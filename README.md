## DC Shared Bike Project 
Data science project using deep learning

-  This project is to investigate shared bike utilization efficiency in DC and look for variables which may affect the usage efficiency.
-  Neural network is implemented to predict the shared bike utilization in DC.
-  Raw data used in this project is directly downloaded from online sources.
